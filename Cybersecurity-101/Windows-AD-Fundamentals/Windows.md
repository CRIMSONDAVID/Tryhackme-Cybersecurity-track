Graphical User Interface (GUI)
  The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is the primary interface for interacting with Windows. It includes the desktop, start menu, taskbar, search box, and task view.
  The GUI provides a visual way to access and manage files, applications, and system settings without using command-line commands.

File System
  Modern Windows uses **NTFS (New Technology File System)**. Key features include:
   - Support for files larger than 4GB
   - Folder and file compression
   - Automatic repair of corrupted files using log files
   - Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
 Legacy file systems include FAT16, FAT32, and HPFS.

System Folders
  - `%windir%\System32` contains essential Windows operating system files.
  - `%windir%` is an environment variable pointing to the Windows installation directory.
  - Environment variables store system information such as OS paths, processor count, and temporary folder locations.

User Accounts and Permissions
  Windows manages users and permissions through:  
   - User Account Control (UAC)  
   - Task Manager  
   - Control Panel  
  Task Manager provides information on running processes and applications. Control Panel allows configuration of account settings and permissions.

System Configuration and Advanced Settings
  The `msconfig` utility allows troubleshooting of startup processes. Tabs include:  
   - General  
   - Boot  
   - Services  
   - Startup  
   - Tools  
  Advanced system settings provide options for performance tuning, environment variables, and modification of User Account Control settings.

Computer Management and System Information
  Computer Management consolidates administrative tools such as:  
   - Task Scheduler  
   - Event Viewer  
   - Performance Monitor  
   - Device Manager  
  System Information provides a comprehensive view of hardware, system components, and the software environment.  

Windows Security
  Windows security components include:  
   - Virus and threat protection  
   - Firewall configurations (Domain, Private, Public profiles)  
   - App and browser control  
   - Windows Update, which delivers security patches and feature updates
