LINUX FUNDAMENTALS-1, 2 and 3

Command Line Interaction

I worked in the Linux terminal to navigate the filesystem and perform core file operations. I used commands such as cd, ls, and pwd to move through directories and inspect paths. I created, copied, moved, and removed files and directories using touch, mkdir, cp, mv, and rm. This allowed me to operate directly within the Linux environment without relying on graphical tools.

File and Content Search

I used find to locate files across the system based on names, patterns, or extensions. I used grep to search inside files for specific text or patterns. These tools enabled direct and efficient discovery of both files and content within the filesystem.

Permissions and Access Control

I examined Linux permission structures using ls -l to interpret read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others. I used su and su -l to switch between users and observe how access changed based on privilege levels. This gave me a clear understanding of how Linux enforces access control.

Process and Job Management

I used ps and ps aux to view running processes and identify process IDs. I controlled processes using signals such as SIGTERM, SIGKILL, and SIGSTOP. I also worked with background and foreground jobs to understand how Linux manages active tasks through the kernel.

Secure Remote Access and File Transfer

I connected to remote machines using SSH to access systems securely over an encrypted channel. I transferred files with SCP and retrieved files from the web using wget. These tasks helped me understand how Linux systems communicate and exchange data in real environments.

Services and System Structure

I interacted with systemd and systemctl to inspect and manage services. I reviewed key Linux directories such as /etc, /var, /root, and /tmp to understand their roles in configuration, system operations, and temporary storage.

Terminal-Based Text Editing

I used Nano and Vim to edit files directly within the terminal. This included modifying configuration files and working with text in environments without a graphical interface.
