I started my cybersecurity journey using the Google Cybersecurity Certificate on Coursera, where I built a strong foundation in security concepts, Linux, networking, and SOC fundamentals.

Due to budget limitations, I transitioned to TryHackMe, where I now focus on hands-on labs, practical security skills, and real-world scenarios.

I share my progress publicly to stay accountable, improve consistently, and connect with others who are also learning cybersecurity.

I’m building skills in:
• Linux and command-line security
• Networking fundamentals
• SOC tools and incident response
• Hands-on defensive and offensive labs on TryHackMe
My goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst and continue growing through practical, affordable learning paths.
