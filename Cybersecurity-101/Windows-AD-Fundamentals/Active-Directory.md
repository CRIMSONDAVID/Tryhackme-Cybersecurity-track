Active Directory Overview

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for centralized management of users, computers, and resources within a network. AD provides:  
- Authentication and access control  
- Centralized resource management  
- Policy enforcement across domains

User and Computer Management
  AD allows monitoring and management of user accounts and computers. This includes:  
   - Tracking login activity and user status  
   - Managing workstations and domain controllers  
   - Controlling services and access permissions  

Group Policies and Authentication Methods
  Group Policies allow administrators to enforce security and configuration standards across users and computers.  
  Authentication methods define how users and devices verify identities before accessing network resources.  

Domain Structures
  Active Directory uses hierarchical structures for network organization:  
   - Trees: Collections of domains sharing a namespace  
   - Forests: Collections of trees sharing a schema  
   - Trusts: Relationships between domains allowing access and resource sharing
